Project Overview
CrypCur is a basic cryptocurrency running on a custom blockchain. It allows nodes to mine blocks, verify transactions, and maintain consensus over the integrity of the blockchain. It showcases all the necessary components of a cryptocurrency system:

Blockchain Structure
Proof of Work Mining Algorithm
Transaction Management
Node Communication via Flask APIs
Blockchain Validation for Tamper-proofing
Features
Blockchain Management: Add and validate new blocks with transactions.
Proof of Work Mining: Implements a basic mining algorithm for block creation.
Transaction System: Create transactions between wallets.
RESTful APIs: Flask-based APIs to interact with the blockchain.
Blockchain Validation: Ensures the chain remains tamper-proof and consistent.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)
- Installing Dependencies
- Clone the repository and install the required packages:



Enhancements
CrypCur is a basic implementation of cryptocurrency. You can extend it with the following features:

-Peer-to-Peer Network: Enable communication between multiple nodes.
-RSA Cryptography: Secure transactions using public and private key pairs.
-Smart Contracts: Introduce programmable contracts on the blockchain.
-Web UI: Build a frontend interface to make the project more interactive.
-Advanced Mining Algorithm: Switch from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake for better efficiency.
