#Crypcur

CrypCur: A Simple Cryptocurrency on Blockchain
This repository contains a complete cryptocurrency project named CrypCur, built with Python. It demonstrates core concepts of blockchain and cryptocurrency creation, including block mining, transaction handling, and blockchain validation. This project provides a strong foundation for further development in the blockchain space.

Project Overview
CrypCur is a basic cryptocurrency running on a custom blockchain. It allows nodes to mine blocks, verify transactions, and maintain consensus over the integrity of the blockchain. It showcases all the necessary components of a cryptocurrency system:

Blockchain Structure
Proof of Work Mining Algorithm
Transaction Management
Node Communication via Flask APIs
Blockchain Validation for Tamper-proofing
Features
Blockchain Management: Add and validate new blocks with transactions.
Proof of Work Mining: Implements a basic mining algorithm for block creation.
Transaction System: Create transactions between wallets.
RESTful APIs: Flask-based APIs to interact with the blockchain.
Blockchain Validation: Ensures the chain remains tamper-proof and consistent.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

Python 3.x
pip (Python package installer)
Installing Dependencies
Clone the repository and install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/crypcur.git
cd crypcur
pip install -r requirements.txt
How to Run
Start the Node Server:
Run the node to handle transactions and mining operations:

bash
Copy code
python node.py
Create a Wallet (Optional):
Generate a wallet to send transactions:

bash
Copy code
python wallet.py
Test the API using cURL or Postman:
Use the endpoints to mine blocks and create transactions (see API Endpoints).

API Endpoints
Mine a Block
Mines a new block and adds it to the blockchain.

http
Copy code
GET /mine
Response:

json
Copy code
{
  "message": "Block mined successfully!",
  "block": { ... }
}
Create a New Transaction
Adds a new transaction to the pending transactions list.

http
Copy code
POST /transactions/new
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "sender": "Alice",
  "receiver": "Bob",
  "amount": 50
}
Response:

json
Copy code
{
  "message": "Transaction will be added to Block 2"
}
Get the Full Blockchain
Retrieves the entire CrypCur blockchain.

http
Copy code
GET /chain
Response:

}
Code Explanation
1. Blockchain Class (blockchain.py)
The Blockchain class manages the blockchain. Key methods include:

create_block: Creates a new block containing pending transactions.
proof_of_work: A simple algorithm that ensures mining requires effort.
is_chain_valid: Verifies the integrity of the blockchain.
2. Node Setup (node.py)
The Flask server acts as a node in the CrypCur blockchain network. It provides RESTful APIs to interact with the blockchain for mining and transactions.

3. Wallet Creation (wallet.py)
This script generates public and private keys for a userâ€™s wallet. It also allows users to send transactions to the blockchain node.

4. Utility Functions (utils.py)
Contains helper functions such as hash_data to hash strings using SHA-256 encryption for blockchain security.

Enhancements
CrypCur is a basic implementation of cryptocurrency. You can extend it with the following features:

Peer-to-Peer Network: Enable communication between multiple nodes.
RSA Cryptography: Secure transactions using public and private key pairs.
Smart Contracts: Introduce programmable contracts on the blockchain.
Web UI: Build a frontend interface to make the project more interactive.
Advanced Mining Algorithm: Switch from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake for better efficiency.
